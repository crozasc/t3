## Description

Develop an application in Jupyter Notebook that displays a history of a complete cycle
of some Machine Learning technique seen in Chapter 5. To do this, you must select
a data set already prepared or that requires simple preparation that is suitable
for the technique to be applied. All this must be done using the tools that
provides the Python programming language through the libraries seen in classes (Numpy,
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Sklearn).

## Usage
Using the Jupyter Notebook tool used blocks
Markdown and Python to tell a story of the input data preparation process
for later use by some data analysis model.
